# Environment variables
# Get your API key from: https://moondream.ai/me/api-keys
#
# NOTE: This file is OPTIONAL. You can manage API keys directly in the app 
# through Settings > API Key Management. The in-app key management is the 
# recommended approach as it allows easy key switching without rebuilding.
#
# If you want to use an environment variable instead, copy this file to .env
# and add your API key below:
